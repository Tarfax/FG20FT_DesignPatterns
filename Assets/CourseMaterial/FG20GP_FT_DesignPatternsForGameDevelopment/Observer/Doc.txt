I am not using the example of the book, but I showed the link for
it's good historical information about the observer pattern.

We will use the C# Action class and the static events instead, for
their ease of implementation and their power.

I did an example showing C# Actions in action:
A button when is clicked it will fire an On Clicked event to which 
2 different objects (Cube & Sphere) subscribe themselves.
When the Event is fired each subscriber react the way he wants:
The Cube switched its color and the Sphere changed its position.
